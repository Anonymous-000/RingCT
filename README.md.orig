# RingCT (MatRiCT VS Matric+)

## Description

This is a _**toy**_ implementation of our work under [**MatRiCT**](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1287.pdf) (**Matric+**) and [**MatRiCT+**](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/545.pdf) (**Matric+_plus**). Please do **NOT** use this in production environment.

The [balance proof](https://github.com/GoldSaintEagle/RingCT_Implementation/blob/master/Matrict.go#L18L74) and [one-out-of-many proof](https://github.com/GoldSaintEagle/RingCT_Implementation/blob/master/Matrict.go#L398L481) are implemented separately to compare with the [linear equation argument](https://github.com/GoldSaintEagle/RingCT_Implementation/blob/master/Matric%2B.go#L18L42) and [unbalanced linear sum proof](https://github.com/GoldSaintEagle/RingCT_Implementation/blob/master/Matric%2B.go#L409L492) in more details.

## Package Required
- The ring operations are provided from [**LAGO**](https://github.com/dedis/lago). Please run `go get github.com/dedis/lago` before testing.

## Remarks
<<<<<<< HEAD
- As the algorithm 9 and 10 in MatRiCT (also in MatRiCT+) only support _**less than two outputs and one input**_ (embedding corrector values in binary proofs), `BalanceProof` function returns directly when dealing with more inputs/outputs. The balance proof verification, `BalanceVerify`, will fail when removing the check of `S` amd `M` in `BalanceProof`, unless corrector values happen to be binaries (in {-1, 0, 1} for MatRiCT+).
- There is a **BUG** in the [`MulPoly`](https://github.com/dedis/lago/blob/789763ed5fb5e3420cc72260ab8d005f8c06ea3f/polynomial/polynomial.go#L143L159) function of [**LAGO**](https://github.com/dedis/lago). Specifically, when dealing with same inputs, `p.MulPoly(p1, p1)`, `p1` will run _**two times of NTT instead of one**_. Thus, `MulPolyBug` is used in this package to indicate whether this bug is fixed or not. This package will work when directly setting this value to `true` without fixing. Alternatively, fixing the bug as follows will make this package more efficient:
